## Examples to Source Code Versioning ##

Examples **AFTER** first / early steps with Git. **Do your other Tasks before!**

Those Examples are simple starting examples to try first development workflow within source code versioning. They are not too complex and major exercise could be to learn git command by those easy development examples.

- [Greeter Example](GitGreeterExercise)
- [Calculator Example](GitCalculatorExercise)

all Exercises should create a basic project skeleton with e.g. Maven Layout and should be commited before demo code will be implemented.

### Git Greeter Exercise ###

Best for 2 students, Exercise is possible up to 3 students. Includes basic steps for introducing git commandos and handling with remote repository. 

Develop a simple demo with two different methods.


### Git Calculator Exercise ###

Best for 2 students, Exercise is possible up to 3 students. Includes basic steps for introducing git commandos and handling with remote repository.

Develop a simple demo with three methods. 2 of 3 methods should be developed by 1 student. The Third method should implemented with 
different approaches to simulate a merge conflict
